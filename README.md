# cuFHE
CUDA-accelerated Fully Homomorphic Encryption Library

v1.0_beta -- release on Mar/14/2018

## What is cuFHE?
The cuFHE library is an open-source library for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) on CUDA-enabled GPUs. It implements the TFHE scheme [CGGI16][CGGI17] proposed by Chillotti et al. in CUDA C++. Compared to the [TFHE lib](https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe) which reports the fastest gate-by-gate bootstrapping performance on CPUs, the cuFHE library yields roughly 20 times of speedup on an NVIDIA Titan Xp graphics card. The cuFHE library benefits greatly from an improved CUDA implementation of the number-theoretic transform (NTT) proposed in the [cuHE library](https://github.com/vernamlab/cuHE) [Dai15] by Dai and Sunar.

| [TFHE lib](https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe) | cuFHE | Speedup |
|---|---|---|
| 13 ms | 0.6 ms | 22 times |

### System Requirements
** The library has been tested on Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 only. **
This "Makefile" is created for Linux systems. Please create your own Makefile for MacOS and Windows. We are working on cross-platform support.

### Installation (Linux)
- Run `make` from the directory `cufhe/` for default compilation. This will
  1. create directories `build` and `bin`,
  2. generate shared libraries `libcufhe_cpu.so` (CPU standalone),
  3. `libcufhe_gpu.so` (GPU support) in `bin` directory, and 3) create test and benchmarking executables `test_api_cpu` and `test_api_gpu` in `bin`.

- Alternatively, run `make cpu` or `make gpu` for individual library and executable.
- Copy the library files and `include` folder to any desirable location.

### User Manual
Use files in `cufhe/test/` as examples. To summarize, follow the following function calling procedures.
```
SetSeed(); // init random generator seed
PriKey pri_key;
PubKey pub_key;
KeyGen(pub_key, pri_key); // key generation
// alternatively, write / read key files
Ptxt pt[2];
pt[0] = 0; // 0 or 1, single bit
pt[1] = 1;
Ctxt ct[2];
Encrypt(ct[0], pt[0], pri_key);
Encrypt(ct[1], pt[1], pri_key);

Initialize(pub_key); // for GPU library
Nand(ct[0], ct[0], ct[1], pub_key); // for CPU library
Nand(ct[0], ct[0], ct[1]); // for GPU library non-parallelized gates
cudaSteam_t stream_id;
cudaStreamCreate(&stream_id);
Nand(ct[0], ct[0], ct[1], stream_id); // for GPU library parallelized gates

Decrypt(pt[0], ct[0], pri_key);
CleanUp(); // for GPU library
```

## Change Log
- **version 1.0_beta** -- released on Mar/14/2018.
  - Supports single-bit unpacked encryption / decryption / gates.
  - C++ interface with CPU and GPU separate libraries.
